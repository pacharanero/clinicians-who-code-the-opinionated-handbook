# Introduction

## Why so opinionated?

The web is full of all the information you could possibly want to read about everything I'm talking about in this book. But as a beginner there's too much. You can't get a frame of reference to help you decide which way to go. 'Analysis Paralysis' stops you making progress. So the whole idea here is I am going to make opinionated recommendations for what to learn and what to spend time on.

The purpose of this book is to give you **ONE GOOD WAY** of getting clinical software written. It's not the 'best' way - just like in clinical practice, often **there IS no single 'best' way**. There are *thousands* of ways to do any given task in tech, and you will of course be forgiven if you decide that the way for you is different to my recommendation. But I'm hoping to defeat the options paralysis, and get you started and productive sooner.

In many ways one of the inspirations for this book was the Advanced Trauma Life Support course. This course was developed in the 1980s, and revolutionised trauma care - not by being right all the time, but by giving practitioners ONE GOOD WAY of managing trauma.

## What this book is not

It's not a textbook that will teach you languages, frameworks, etc. I'll link to the places I know of to learn those things
I'll link you to the websites for official documentation
I want to get on to the health relevant coding as quickly as possible without getting bogged down in re-teaching what is already well-taught all over the web
