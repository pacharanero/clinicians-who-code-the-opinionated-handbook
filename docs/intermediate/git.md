!!! tip "Mantra - Own the pain of learning"
    If you find something hard, **that's** exactly when you're learning.

    Take a moment to recognise that feeling of difficulty, maybe even frustration. **Own** it.
    
    Acknowledge that **it is hard because you're learning**, not because of any other imagined reason such as that you are inadequate or don't have the right sort of brain.
    
    Lean into that difficulty, apply your capability, and keep at it. Success will come, but not immediately.

    NB (Mark Bailey) - and when you find you are not getting to the answer you thought you
    were looking for, phone a friend (-ly  clinician-who-codes, there is a growing group
    of us).
