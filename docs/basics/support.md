# Sources of Help and Support

Where you get help from often depends on the question you're asking

* Copy and paste the error message into Google
* stackoverflow
* Digital Health Networks, especially CWC section
* Twitter
* Online forums for the technology in question
* ChatGPT

Note that NHS IT and services such as the Spine sadly don't (at the time of writing) have any open forums to help you integrate with them. This is a source of deep frustration for me, because providing proper online support channels is really such a basic part of providing a service, and is cheap, easy, and completely *expected* in the 'real tech world'.

* OpenHealthHub.org
