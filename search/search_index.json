Because of the amount of intangible bits of information you need to hold in your brain all the time when you ar coding on anything even moderately challenging, it can take a good 20-30 minutes to really get 'into' the coding. If you're interrupted - by, say, having to answer the door for a delivery - you lose that focus, and you have to spend time getting back into 'the zone'. Sometimes whole days of poor productivity result from just being unable to get enough focus to get the job done. Occasionally you have to write off a whole day because of repeated distractions. The distractions don't always come from outside or from other people. You can't insulate yourself from all distractions, but you can do some things to try to reduce them. Find a place to code with fewer distractions around. It needn't be silent. But if you can see a load of jobs to do, or are being called by name all the time, you'll struggle to find focus. Make yourself comfortable. Aim for a good posture, yes of course, but mostly aim to be comfortable. I sometimes code laid out on the sofa. Headphones can help. A developer friend of mine once said that he wears headphones 100% of the time at work - even if he's not actually listening to music! - he felt it definitely stops people from interrupting your focus unless they really needed to. A decent pair of headphones will isolate you from outside noise, and also give you immense listening pleasure! I've found that listening to instrumental music can let you fall into focus easier. Classical music or any other instrumental music works, although I've particularly found that music with a steady, semi-hypnotic beat works really well. I've become quite a fan of the Carbon Based Lifeforms and also a genre called Psybient/Psychill. There are some good Concentration/Coding playlists on Spotify and YouTube. 'Lo-fi beats' also seem to help with focus. (I'm way too old to be making any kind of music recommendations to anyone, but if I was going to, this is what I'd say) Music is very individual though. Listen to what works for you. Instrumental Metal? Bardcore? If you have a really excitingly productive day, it's often followed by a day which is disappointingly scatterbrained and aimless. And vice versa. So don't worry about these 'off' days whatsoever, the next day will likely be back to normal. Roll with the off days. If your brain won't write code on those days, then let it do whatever you can get it to do. Maybe rest? Come back to the code another day.

It also encourages, through convention , the use of good practices. I like this way of standardising things.

Here are a few that I would recommend, but what's available is changing all the time - let me know if you hit problems with something I'm recommending here, or if you know of better resources. Improve this book! If you have found an error, or have something to contribute that would improve the book, you can email me , create a GitHub Issue , or even submit a Pull Request CodeCademy \u00b6 This is where I learned Python originally, and still a great course. You learn step-by-step and everything is in a browser so you don't need to be able to install things on the local machine to be able to learn. This is great when you're in clinical work but have a short break and want to do some learning. https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python The Python 2 course is free, and really there is very little difference between Python 2 and 3 at this level, so I'd say you're fine learning Python 2 here. learnpython.org \u00b6 Another great, web based site which steps you through the main things you need to learn to be able to code in Python. https://www.learnpython.org/ Python Koans \u00b6 This project was ported over from Ruby (another language which is quite similar to Python) - and originally I did these Koans in Ruby. I'm not sure if I actually completed them all, though. The nice thing about them is that they run in your terminal, offline, so if you don't have an internet connection you can still do them. I remember doing these on the train to London from Yorkshire, when connections where patchy. https://github.com/gregmalcolm/python_koans My Python tips \u00b6 Using pyenv for 'virtualenvs' and Python version management \u00b6 Once you are writing Python programs on your local machine regularly, and especially if you are working with other people's code or on shared projects, you'll inevitably hit a situation where you need to have multiple different versions of a Python package installed on your computer, or different versions of Python itself. Use pyenv \u00b6 Although Python has a number of tools available to help manage this problem, I found pyenv to be the easiest to use. It allows you to manage Python versions and your collections of libraries on a 'per-project' basis very easily. Tip At first I remember thinking it was a lot of extra hassle to bother with pyenv , especially when you are just starting, but it really does pay dividends later when you find it's really easy to have numerous different python versions and library collections on your machine.

I'm going to end that 'options paralysis' for you right now by advising, no - asking - you to learn Python. Why 'asking'? - because I believe that as Clinicians Who Code we have to band together and collectivise around a language that we can all use, and more importantly, we need to build tools that solve problems and then share those tools widely and openly in standard ways like using the PyPi , the Python Package Index. If that's enough for you, then you can skip right on to learning how to Python! You will learn other tools later. But start with Python. But if you need some more in-depth reasoning for why to learn Python, then read on. Why it matters to get on and learn Python now , and then learn other stuff later \u00b6 When I started wanting to code, I asked some friends what would be a good language to learn. I got a variety of answers, but it took me some time to make decent conclusions about whether they were the right things to learn. In short, I wasted quite a bit of time learning languages that were either terrible (Java) or the wrong thing (C) for my needs. So you can skip all that and cut to the chase. Learn Python . One person said \"Learn Java because it's 'Enterprise-y' and healthcare applications sound like they are Enterprise-y\". Another advised me to start with the basics and learn C or C++ so that I could write super-fast programs. I actually bought books on both of these and really didn't hit it off with either. I then tried Python and subsequently Ruby, and I immediately found them more friendly and straightforward. I've also played around with newer, languages like Elixir and Golang, as well as PHP, Javascript, and Rust. But if you want my advice, Learn Python . This is a roundabout way of saying that none of the languages you could choose are 'right' or 'wrong'. Many of the available alternative languages are absolutely excellent languages. That's in fact what makes it so hard to decide. And you can easily plough a lot of your time into the learning curves of a variety of different languages, tyrying to decide what is right for you, when you could be making useful things for healthcare if you just Learn Python . I also believe there is a critical mass effect thing here as well. By concentrating the resources of the Clinicians Who Code community around Python, we can make more progress than if we spread ourselves across numerous languages, tools and frameworks. Why the choice of language matters less than you think, once you get going \u00b6 If we are designing our clinical digital tools right, then actually we should be building them so that the inputs and outputs are language agnostic , in other words, that the language used to process the data doesn't matter to the user. So, since the choice of language isn't all that important, it's even more reason not to faff about deciding, and just get on and Learn Python . Example If I build a clinical calculator program, I could make it so that the data going in is in a language-agnostic format such as JSON, and the data coming out is also language-agnostic too: # the input data is in JSON in the { } bit # we pass it to our program 'creatinine-ckd-epi' using the 'pipe': | $ echo \"{'sex': 'male', 'serum_creatinine': 50, 'age': 80, 'race': 'non-black'}\" | ./creatinine-ckd-epi # result - the output data is also in JSON format, in the { } bit { 'value' : 97 , 'units' : 'ml/min/1.73m2' } This is an over-simplifed example, but it is here just to explain that we can make our programs in such a way that it doesn't matter what language we wrote them in. We can this and other methods like REST APIs to wrap our code so that it can be called from programs written in any language. Why choosing a single language across a community does matter \u00b6 If every clinician set off on their own independent learning journey and chose a language almost at random, then sure, we'd have a lot of Clinicians Who Code, but the opportunities for collaboration are greatly reduced. If we choose to stick together then we can all help out on each others' code. We can also share libraries of code, all in Python, that help each other to do things that are currently rather hard to do. Healthcare tech is a long way behind the rest of the tech world in terms of the reusable, shared libraries of code that make things easier in our 'domain of expertise'. There are huge numbers of good quality libraries available for statistics, cryptography, and so much else, but comparatively little that would help us in medicine. Fictional Libraries... As a quick example, wouldn't it be great if there were already libraries to calculate some of the parameters we use in everyday care? It would! - unfortunately they just don't exist yet . I want to be able to do something like: $ python # start the python interpreter >>> import snomedct # import some fictional libraries >>> import ckdepi # calculate an eGFR from Serum Creatinine using a standard algorithm >>> egfr = ckdepi . Creatinine ( sex : 'male' , serum_creatinine : 50 , age : 80 , race : 'non-black' ); print ( egfr ) { 'value' : 97 , 'units' : 'ml/min/1.73m2' } # work out the CKD stage from the eGFR >>> ckd_stage = ckdepi . Staging ( creatinine_clearance [ 'value' ]); print ( ckd_stage ) { 'value' : 'CKD stage I' } # Get the appropriate SNOMED-CT term >>> sct = snomedct . search ( ckd_stage [ 'value' ]); print ( sct ) { 'sct_id' : '431855005' , 'text' : 'Chronic kidney disease stage 1 (disorder)' } # Print a report! >>> print ( f \"Kidney Report: \\n Status: { sct [ 'text' ] } \\n Store as SNOMED-CT: { sct [ 'sct_id' ] } \\n eGFR value: { egfr [ 'value' ] } { egfr [ 'units' ] } \" ) Kidney Report : Status : Chronic kidney disease stage 1 ( disorder ) Store as SNOMED - CT : 431855005 eGFR value : 97 ml / min / 1.73 m2 If dozens or hundreds of Clinicians Who Code built just one library each, that solves a personal programming need, and publish these libraries in open source so we can all review and improve them, we would soon build an international, community-curated collection of safe, independently-clinically-validated libraries that would make the above example possible, turning it from a quite hard problem to solve (which it is currently, it's several day's work at least) to something you could happily do in 5 minutes. That's what I mean by building a critical mass behind Python as a clinical programming language. You don't need to optimise for scale or speed at the start \u00b6 Programmer brains by far the most expensive commodity in the technology world. Doubly so for the Clinician Who Codes, where you are bringing domain expertise to every line of code. CPU cycles are cheap and are always getting cheaper. The most common reason for an idea to fail is not that it was too slow to scale. It's actually that it never got built in the first place. That's where most ideas die. In development. Ideas are worthless; execution on ideas is everything. So, choose a language that lets you build things quickly, right now . Efficient syntax, easy to learn, developer friendly, and has rich libraries. A big developer community so you can ask questions on StackOverflow and get sensible answers. A mature language so you know it will be around for a while. Good, enterprise-grade web frameworks. Y'know. Python, basically. Another reason not to worry preematurely about scale is that the scale of the NHS is tiny in comparison to the 'real tech world' of WhatsApp and Facebook. Even if you had every NHS staff member simultaneously logged into your app, this is about 1.5 million people. WhatsApp can get 2 million concurrent connections out of one server , but by the time you need to optimise your app for this kind of performance you'll have a large team to help you! Scaling too early introduces a lot of complexity to your setup and deployment. Build so that future scaling is possible (with cloud deployments this is very easy anyway) but don't build using a fashionable new language for speed and performance if it is going to make initial development much slower. Fix I remember hearing on a podcast about coding that you should just tweak just one little thing in your programming workflow every day . This could be by simply adding a useful plugin to your editor, a helpful accessory to your desktop, finding a physically better place to work. But each thing you fix makes you more efficient and better focused.

As an interpreted (as opposed to compiled ) language, the 'type-it- try-it -fix-it- try-it ' cycle is that much shorter. It's supported in 'serverless' deployment features by basically all the major platforms such as Heroku, Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, so it's quite easy to deploy experiments and demos. You can use it in Jupyter Notebook form, which is great for data science experiments, live coding demos, and sharing step-by-step code examples. Python's the de-facto science language \u00b6 Python is widely used for all the 'standard' and common things that we use code for - scripting, small simple programs, desktop programs with a graphical user interface, and web programming. In addition, it's been adopted as the primary language of the scientific community, for uses ranging from astrophysics to bioinformatics. Python's scientific and statistical libraries are mature and well supported. Python is also used in a lot of 'cutting edge' things such as machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision and image recognition. Data science also uses a lot of Python although that community is also strongly invested in the R language, which is specifically aimed at statistical analysis and data visualisation. Medicine is (primarily) a scientific discipline. Yeah, it's an art too, but for the computing side of things, science is the way to go. Let's give scientific tools to the humans who practice the art of medicine. I love the phrase 'Machine Assisted Human' . It's something I came up with when trying to describe what we were doing with the UI of a new GP system. We're not trying to replace the human, we're trying to give the human practitioner 'super-powers'. That's the future of medicine. One language, Critical mass \u00b6 So, to make progress faster, we need to group together and 'centralise' our efforts around a single language, or at most a small cluster of languages and frameworks, building and sharing tools that make us all more efficient and productive. Although I am confident that any clinician of any kind, from any background, can learn to code, the fact remains that at present there aren't all that many of us Clinicians Who Code yet. One day, all clinicians will be able to code. It probably isn't that far away - 10-20 years? So let's start building now the tools that those clinicians will need. We need to collectivise our efforts behind a single language so that we focus on developing the ecosystem of tools and libraries of code that are needed. If we're spread across many languages then we simply won't hit a 'critical mass', or at least it could take longer to hit it. Python's ecosystem \u00b6 Python has a huge ecosystem of mature, reliable tools in its libraries. Libraries are called different things in different languages, but they all do the same essential function - they are reusable units of code that you can use in your programs to make it easier to make progress faster. Python has a great Web Framework (a library which makes it easier to build web applications) called Django, which is used at full production scale for a number of major websites including Instagram , Pinterest and Udemy . The daily traffic going through these sites is probably a million times the entire NHS data throughput. Django will cope fine. If you get to the point where parts of your application need to be replatformed to a faster-performing language because of the sheer volume of traffic, then you have a Champagne Problem . Until then, you'll be fine with these tools. See Solving Imaginary Scaling Issues At Scale Community \u00b6 A word you will read a fair bit in this book is 'Community'. You are part of building a community of Clinicians Who Code, but also, we're part of a larger community - of all coders, and also - a community of all clinicians. We're a very special part of the Venn diagram. I've built up several communities within health tech - the main ones being and , and there are a few others. Community is hugely important. It gives the members a place to talk, to learn, understand, discuss, and disagree. We can use a community to explore the Zone Of Uncomfortable Debate . Communities make us more productive, simply because we can learn from each other. It's a right that you have, in any good community, to ask for help, and you should get it. Similarly, as you start to accrue knowledge in the community, it's a responsibility of yours now to share your knowledge with the other members. Be nice. You were a beginner too, once. Miscellaneous other reasons... \u00b6 Want to use a C program in Python? - no problem, it has several easy ways to wrap a C library in a Python wrapper. Want to use Python for Internet Of Things development? - you can use Python for that: https://micropython.org/ Things I don't love so much about Python \u00b6 (But still learn Python please...) Pydantry \u00b6 Python likes things to be done the right way, and the design of the language is intended to give you 'one good way' of doing things (just like the ATLS course). Occasionally this can make it seem like Python is being annoyingly pedantic, as seen in this commonly encountered example: Pydantry in motion \u2570\u2500$ python Python 3.8.0 ( default , Aug 23 2020 , 17 : 45 : 09 ) [ GCC 9.3.0 ] on linux Type \"help\" , \"copyright\" , \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information . >>> exit Use exit () or Ctrl - D ( i . e . EOF ) to exit >>> I typed exit - Python clearly understood what I intended to do, because it gave me advice on how to successfully exit. But it wants me to do it the right way, so it's going to deliberately not exit and wait superciliously for me to do it properly . It's not Ruby \u00b6 This is a minor complaint, since Ruby is fairly close in style to Python. But in Python, things like method chaining look ugly: len ( \"My_Text\" . upper () . split ( '_' )[ 1 ] . encode ()) Notice all the empty parentheses () ? And the fact that sometimes you use dot notation to chain the operations, and other times you enclose the expression with a function call len() . There's probably some logic in there somewhere, but certainly no elegance. Same thing in Ruby: \"My_Text\" . upcase . split ( '_' ) [ 1 ]. encode . length Just cleaner and neater. Elegant and well thought through. But despite this, I've had to get over myself, suck it up, and stick to Python for any projects that other people might need to get involved in. So should you. Late night problem solving Never underestimate the problem solving potential of a decent night's sleep. If you really can't make it work, put it away for the night. Your brain is still going to be working on it. And you get to sleep through it all. Over night, quite often, the solution will just be obvious in the morning. And if it's still not obvious - at least you're now attacking it with a well-rested brain.","title":"Why Python?"},{"location":"getting-started/why-python/#why-python","text":"Why is Python a good language to learn first?","title":"Why Python?"},{"location":"getting-started/why-python/#ease-of-learning-and-use","text":"Python is taught in schools across the world, to children from around the age of 8 upwards.
